Cleaning/ Transforming the Data: 

- removing the `asdbehaviors` and `lostskillsdemographics` columns becuase they make up the outcome
- removing the baby language as a predictor 

```{r}
cbdata <- ChatterBabyData[,-c(1:7, 217:240)]
```



Transforming the weight from kg to pounds then cbind into the same column for lbs: 

```{r,warning=FALSE}
# Convert weight in kg to lbs then to character vector
cbdata$weightkg <- as.numeric(cbdata$weightkg)
cbdata$weightkg <- as.character(round(2.20462 * cbdata$weightkg,2))
rename(cbdata, weightlb = weightkg)

# replace the missing values in `babysweightlbs` with values from weightkg
cbdata <- cbdata %>% mutate(babysweightlbs=ifelse(babysweightlbs=="NA", weightkg, babysweightlbs))

# Convert to numeric
cbdata$babysweightlbs <- round(as.numeric(cbdata$babysweightlbs), 2)

# Convert all Colic NA's to 0: 
cbdata$colic[is.na(cbdata$colic)] <- 0 

# getting rid of the weightkg:
